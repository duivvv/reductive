# Reductive

A reimplementation of [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) in [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason).

## Word of Caution

**[You might not need this library](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**, especially so in a language which provides good enough construction blocks out of the box. **ReasonReact [already comes with reducers](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2017/09/01/reducers.html)**!

However, in the spirit of unifying the Reason community around an authoritative Redux implementation and to avoid churn, we'll polish Reductive to make it production-ready for those who do wish to use it anyway.

## Comparisons with Redux

### Actions
Redux [actions](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html) are implemented as plain JS objects. JS objects can be a bit too flexible, and many Redux users rely on standardized shapes for their actions to make sure that middlewares and third party libraries work with them. Reason has language-level support for composing a set of data types which many functions can operate over. They are called [variants](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/language/data-types#variants) and you can see how they are used [here](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/examples/basic/simpleStore.re).

### Action Creators
Redux [action creators](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html#action-creators) are used as composable ways of generating plain JS objects that match the schema of a specific action. In Reason, the type system does a lot of this work for you, so you can reliably put action types directly in your code and know that things will Just Workâ„¢. This has an added performance advantage of shifting that function call to compile time.

### Enhancer Composition
Much of the power of redux comes from having a unified API for writing and using middleware or enhancers. They're typically wired together behind the scenes in the [applyMiddlewares function](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/applyMiddleware.html). This function doesn't exist in Reductive, because Reason has language-level support for function composition with operators like [`|>` and `@@`](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html#6_Compositionoperators). You can see some [example usage here](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/examples/immutable/timeTravelStore.re#L86-L87) and [some of the deprecation messages](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/src/reductive.rei#L39-L112) to get a better understanding of typical usage.

### The Source
The code behind Reductive is incredibly simple. The [first 40 lines](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/src/reductive.re#L1-L40) Include the entire reimplementation of [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). The [next ~40 lines](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/src/reductive.re#L42-L83) are a reimplementation of the [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) library (without the higher-order component connect style implementation). The code is short and relatively simple to follow.

## Alternative to Reductive

Hopefully, the above comparisons demonstrated that **you might not need an extra-react state management technique at all**; passing props down works well in [Reason-React](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react), and since props are well-typed, adding/remove them takes seconds. Keep state/props management simple so that you can spend the learning budget elsewhere!

Current needs:

* Potential bug fixes
* Better examples usages
* More docs on differences from/similarities with Redux
* Different examples of/links to simpler state management in Reason
